    <h3> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data without explicit programming.</h3>
